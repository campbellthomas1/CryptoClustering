# CryptoClustering

*** In this actvity I created models to predict if crypto currencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. I used pandas, hvplot, and sklearn to do this.
*** The activity was a bit challenging as I began to think that some of the clusters did not seem right. I managed to grasp an understanding of the project as I worked though.
